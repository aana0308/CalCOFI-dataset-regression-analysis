# Problem Statement 
The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) are a unique partnership of the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, NOAA Fisheries Service and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The organization was formed in 1949 to study the ecological aspects of the sardine population collapse off California. The CalCOFI data set represents the longest (1949-present) and most complete (more than 50,000 sampling stations) time series of oceanographic and larval fish data in the world. It includes abundance data on the larvae of over 250 species of fish; larval length frequency data and egg abundance data on key commercial species; and oceanographic and plankton data. The physical, chemical, and biological data collected at regular time and space intervals quickly became valuable for documenting climatic cycles in the California Current and a range of biological responses to them. CalCOFI research drew world attention to the biological response to the dramatic Pacific-warming event in 1957-58 and introduced the term “El Niño” into the scientific literature.

Data collected at depths down to 500 m include: temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite, chlorophyll, transmissometer, PAR, C14 primary productivity, phytoplankton biodiversity, zooplankton biomass, and zooplankton biodiversity. 

The aim is to find whether or not there is a relationship between water salinity & water temperature and if the water temperature can be predicted based on salinity?

## Dataset

The dataset used is the CalCOFI dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/calcofi/download) from Kaggle. Regression analysis will be used for the given task.

**Target Variable: Water temperature**
<br>
<br>
Water temperature refers to the temperature of the water sample in degree Celsius
<br>
**Mean water temperature:** 10.799677	degree Celsius
<br>
**Max water temperature:** 31.140000 degree Celsius
<br>
**Min water temperature:** 1.440000 degree Celsius


## Model(s) Used

The models used are liner regression and

**Linear regression :**
Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). The linear equation assigns one scale factor to each input value or column, called a coefficient and represented by the capital Greek letter Beta (B). One additional coefficient is also added, giving the line an additional degree of freedom (e.g. moving up and down on a two-dimensional plot) and is often called the intercept or the bias coefficient.
